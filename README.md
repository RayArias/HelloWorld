# HelloWorld 

This is a repository for me to explore and sandbox with different programming languages.

So far, there is a Basic language version and a Java version.

I'm starting with languages I'm already familiar with and go from there. Languages I may do, or at least attempt lol, are COBOL, JavaScript, and Python.

Also, I made space for a personal miscellaneous coding To-Do list.
