# HelloWorld 

This is a repository for me to explore and sandbox with different programming languages.

So far, there are a Basic language version, a Java version, and a Pascal version.

I'm starting with languages I'm already familiar with and go from there. Languages I may do, or at least attempt lol, are COBOL, JavaScript, and Python.

Also, I made space for a personal miscellaneous coding To-Do list.

Note: If you are browsing the code, most versions of HelloWorld are usually in one file. If you see more than one file with the same extension, such as .java, then all of those files comprise that version of HelloWorld. For example, the Java version has 4 files. Every file or collection of files here is the latest version in its respective language.
